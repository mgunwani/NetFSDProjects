Compononents of OOPS:

	Classes
	Objects
	Encapsulation
	Abstraction
	Inheritance
	Polymorphism
	
------------------------------------------

Access Specifiers in C#:

	Private: Private Members are accessible in itw own class only.
	Public: Public Members accessible from anywhere.
	Protected: Protected Members are accessible in its own class and child class.
	Internal: Internal members are accessible within the namespace.
	
	Note:
		All members of a class by default private or encapuslated.
		By default, a class has internal access modifier.
		
------------------------------------------

Polymorphism:

	Poly means Many and Morpho Forms.
	
	"One Interface Many Function."
	
	Non-Technical Example: Human Being
	Technical Example: Visual Studio 
	
	Polymorphism can be achieve by Overloading and OVerridding.
	
	Overloading:
	
		A mechanism to have more than on method with same name but with different signatue within a class.
		
		A method signature will be differentiated by:
		
			- Number of Parameters
			- Type of Parameters
			- Sequence of Parameters
			
	Overridding:
	
		Overridding means redefine the method in child classes.
		
		Overridden method should have:
		
			Same Name
			Same Parameters
			Same Return Type
			Same or Higher Access Modifier
